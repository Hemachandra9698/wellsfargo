## Overview

This is your new Kedro project, which was generated using `Kedro 0.18.1`.

Take a look at the [Kedro documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io) to get started.

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a [data engineering convention](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention)
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `src/requirements.txt` for `pip` installation and `src/environment.yml` for `conda` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

To configure the coverage threshold, go to the `.coveragerc` file.

## Project dependencies

To generate or update the dependency requirements for your project:

```
kedro build-reqs
```

This will `pip-compile` the contents of `src/requirements.txt` into a new file `src/requirements.lock`. You can see the output of the resolution by opening `src/requirements.lock`.

After this, if you'd like to update your project requirements, please update `src/requirements.txt` and re-run `kedro build-reqs`.
